# Delfi Paywalled Articles Remover Version 1.

Changes paywalled articles from Delfi.ee and Postimees.ee news portal to have opacity of 0.1. This version is "selfish". It crawls via the extensions background.js doing couple hundred fetch requests in the first few seconds. The effect is somewhat like a mini DDOS against the server. Crawled links and paywalled links are stored on local storage to minimize subsequent requests. 

This is meant as proof of concept rather than something to be realistically used.
